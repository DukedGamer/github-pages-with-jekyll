# Welcome World, This Is Truth #

"He who stands on tiptoe
doesn't stand firm.
He who rushes ahead
doesn't go far.
He who tries to shine
dims his own light.
He who defines himself
can't know who he really is.
He who has power over others
can't empower himself.
He who clings to his work
will create nothing that endures." 

Lao Tzu

The urge to be ahead of others has lead 
to some tripping over their own feet to
seek more control/money/material goods.
Yet when somenone who has power and desires
only more, they will often disrupt the 
mass population to gain such desires.

This leads to lies being told, and if a
lie is told enough, it becomes the 'truth',
if the lie is told through generations, it
becomes culture and from here... it becomes
reality.

Question what you know.
